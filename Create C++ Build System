---------------------------
Creating a c++ build system
---------------------------
Step 1 Open Sublime Text editor and then go to Tools > Build System > New Build System.

Step 2. Paste the following code in the file
{
    "cmd": ["g++.exe", "-std=c++17", "${file}",
            "-o", "${file_base_name}.exe",
            "&&", "${file_base_name}.exe<inputf.in>outputf.out"],
    "shell":true,
    "working_dir":"$file_path",
    "selector":"source.cpp"
}

Step3. Save it and name the file as "CP.sublime-build" {.sublime-build is must}
The above block of code is used for taking input from the file “inputf.in” and prints the output to “outputf.out”.

----------------------------
Setting up the Window Layout
----------------------------
Step 1. Create three new files as shown below and make sure all of them are in the same folder.
- file.cpp: The file for writing the code.
- inputf.in: The file where we will be giving the input.
- outputf.out: The file where the output will be displayed.

Step 2. For layout follow the below steps
Select View > Layout > Columns : 3. This will create three columns in the workspace. Move the three files into three columns.
Select View > Groups > Max Columns : 2.

Step 3. Select the build system we just created from Tools > Build System > CP.
